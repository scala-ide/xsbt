sbt 0.11.1 contains mainly bug fixes and minor features.  There are some notable changes:

* New Getting Started Guide and wiki reorganization
* Task interruption using ctrl+c
* Finer 'update' logging is on by default.
* Improved memory usage and performance of incremental recompilation using an approached based on signature hashes.
* Improved correctness of incremental recompilation, 'update' related caching, and transitive plugin dependencies.
* Added inline API for excluding dependencies.
* Improved functionality for advanced build manipulations, including inter-project dependency modification by a setting.

For task interruption, tasks must respond to the main thread being interrupted.  In particular, a task must not ignore InterruptedException and must interrupt any threads it has started.

The previous behavior for 'update' logging may be enabled by setting 'ivyLoggingLevel := UpdateLogging.Quiet'.
